# Apple Mockup
This mockup of a former homepage for Apple was developed as part of The Odin Project's [Ruby on Rails Curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com) as practice for creating backgrounds and gradients, as well as for experimenting more with HTML and CSS.

The page can be viewed [here](https://naomiflagg.github.io/apple-mockup/), and the original Apple page can be viewed [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20140301004610/http://www.apple.com/).
